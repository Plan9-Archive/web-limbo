# status

useful, some modules won't be used much though.


# intro

web - a collection of code for dealing with "the web".


# install

make sure you have $ROOT set, now "mk install" to compile and install
the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

the following libraries are installed:
* template, for making templates, useful for generating html
* cgi, for parsing query-parts of urls
* htmlent, for converting html entities (such as &quot;) to normal text
* ohttp, old http library.  do not use for new code, instead use nhttp,
  which will become just http when good enough.
* rssgen, for generating rss files

appl/cmd contains test programs that use these libraries.

appl/cmd/scgils.b is a scgi program that displays directory listings,
for use with scgid.

- clean up & write documentation.
- think about whether doing cgi scripts in shell script is worth
  the trouble, and how to do it best.
