useful, some modules won't be used much though.


# intro

web - a collection of code for dealing with "the web".


# install

to install make sure this directory has a mkconfig.  you can bind/symlink
the mkconfig from your inferno installation.  now execute "mk install"
and all should be well.

the following libraries are installed:
* template, for making templates, useful for generating html
* cgi, for parsing query-parts of urls
* htmlent, for converting html entities (such as &quot;) to normal text
* ohttp, old http library.  do not use for new code, instead use nhttp,
  which will become just http when good enough.
* rssgen, for generating rss files

appl/cmd contains test programs that use these libraries.

appl/cmd/scgils.b is a scgi program that displays directory listings,
for use with scgid.
