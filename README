web - a collection of code for dealing with "the web"

to install make sure this directory has a mkconfig.  you can bind/symlink
the mkconfig from your inferno installation.  now execute "mk install"
and all should be well.

the following libraries are present:
* template, for making templates, useful for generating html
* cgi, for parsing query-parts of urls
* htmlent, for converting html entities (such as &quot;) to normal text
* ohttp, old http library.  do not use for new code, instead use nhttp,
  which will become just http when good enough.

appl/cmd contains test programs that use these libraries.

appl/cmd/scgils.b is a scgi program that displays directory listings,
for use with scgid.

writing documentation is on my todo list.

all files are in the public domain.  bug reports, new code, comments
and more are welcome at mechiel@xs4all.nl or mechiel@ueber.net.
